This project focuses on Segmenting an image consisting of multiple watermelons in it.
It follows the approach of Supervised Learning.

In order to create a model, first provide an image where multiple cut pieces of watermelons are present. Then give few inputs for the skin and foreground of the melons.
The program uses the concept of Mahalanobis distance and segments the melons with respect to skin and foreground and draws a blue line separating the two.

You can use the model generated and pass on any image having melons pieces and the program will use this model and provide a segmented output.
